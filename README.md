# 📊 SQL Case Studies with Data Cleaning in Python (NumPy & pandas)

This repository serves as a general framework for working on **SQL-based case studies**, followed by **data cleaning and analysis in Python**, using only **NumPy** and **pandas**.

It's designed for anyone looking to sharpen their SQL logic while leveraging Python for deeper data manipulation—without relying on visualization libraries.

## ✅ What's Included

- 📂 SQL scripts for data querying, filtering, and transformation
- 🧼 Python notebooks for data cleaning and preparation
- 📈 Structured analysis using `pandas` and `numpy` (no plots, just clean code and logic)

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

### 1️⃣ SQL Case Study (Database or File-Based)

- Write queries to extract and understand raw data
- Use techniques like `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, filtering, and user-defined functions
- Prepare the dataset for downstream Python analysis

### 2️⃣ Python-Based Data Cleaning & Structuring

Using only **pandas** and **NumPy**, we:
- Load SQL outputs or CSV files
- Handle missing or inconsistent data
- Normalize and format columns (strings, dates, numbers)
- Perform transformations and feature creation
- Apply filters, aggregations, and reshaping (pivot, melt, etc.)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **SQL** (MySQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL)
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
